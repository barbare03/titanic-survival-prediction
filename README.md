# titanic-survival-prediction
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using a dataset from Kaggle. It includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and a machine learning model to make predictions.
# Project Overview
This project uses logistic regression to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, sex, number of siblings/spouses aboard, and port of embarkation. The model is trained on the Kaggle Titanic dataset and evaluated on a validation set. A CSV submission file is generated for scoring on Kaggle.

# Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas
sklearn
If you are running this on Google Colab, make sure to mount Google Drive to access your datasets and save your submission file.

# Dataset
The data used is from the Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview). Place the train.csv and test.csv files in your Google Drive, under My Drive/Colab Notebooks/.
